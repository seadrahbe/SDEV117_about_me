        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          Hello, my name is Seadrah! Although I was born in Tacoma, Washington,
          I was raised all around the Pacific Northwest, spending around 7 years
          in Oregon and 7 years in Idaho during my childhood. I've moved around
          50 times and have attended 13 different schools. From my time spent
          traveling state-to-state, I have acclimated to the unique culture of
          each state, and experienced the wide diversity of the families living
          within each state. In high school, I settled down in Washington and
          have stayed here ever since. I attend Green River College, where I've
          spent some time exploring classes and developing my passions. After a
          journey of majoring in Environmental Science, Communications, Software
          Development, and Computer Science (consecutively), I've settled into
          Software Development and decided to complete my studies at Green River
          while staying active in student life.

      <h3>Interests</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Language & Culture</strong> - I have functional fluency in
          Spanish and am hoping to learn mandarin soon. I enjoy traveling &
          meeting people from various backgrounds.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Communication</strong> - I majored in communication briefly,
          as it's something that has fascinated me since high school. In high
          school, I suffered From social anxiety, and struggled to speak to
          others. However, I spent a year studying, listening to podcasts, and
          building my Communication skills, which paid off spectacularly. I
          believe communication is one of the most beneficial skills to develop.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Social Justice</strong> - It's important for me to uphold
          ethical standards in the work I do in the technology sector,
          especially in the current political climate. I'm passionate about
          advocating for the human rights and representation of marginalized
          communities, especially through diversity, equity, and inclusion
          efforts.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Poetry</strong> - Poetry and art in general is one of my
          favorite outlets for creativity and self-expression. I think artistic
          expression is empowering and can help us express the parts of ourself
          that lack a voice.
